Yueyuan joined our lab as a postdoctoral researcher in October 2021 and serves as a bioinformatics lead. She has made outstanding contributions to our research, playing key roles in two major projects. The first involves leading the data analysis for scHiCAR, a cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics method that simultaneously profiles the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and 3D genome organization in the same individual cells. This technology allows high-resolution mapping of regulatory interactions, including long-range enhancers, and has the potential to transform our understanding of chromatin-based gene regulation in complex tissues. The second project is an integrative research program focused on elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying failed skeletal muscle regeneration in peripheral artery disease (PAD).
