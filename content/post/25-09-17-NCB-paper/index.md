This study focuses on transposable elements — mobile pieces of DNA that originated from ancient viruses and now make up nearly half of the human genome. Long considered by scientists to be genetic parasites or “junk DNA” with no purpose, these elements are now shown to be key players in how cells respond to physical forces in their environment. 

These findings open doors to potential breakthroughs in regenerative medicine and cancer treatment.
